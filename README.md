VC-2 Conformance Testing Software
=================================

This repository contains software tools for checking the conformance of VC-2
video codec implementations to the [SMPTE ST 2042-1 (VC-2) family of
standards](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7967896).


Getting started
---------------

This software comes with a detailed user's manual which walks through the
process of installing and using these tools.

This software builds on the following support libraries:

* [`vc2_data_tables`](https://github.com/bbc/vc2_data_tables): Data tables and
  constant definitions from the VC-2 standard.

* [`vc2_bit_widths`](https://github.com/bbc/vc2_bit_widths) Mathematical
  routines for computing near worst case signals for VC-2 codecs.

* [`vc2_conformance_data`](https://github.com/bbc/vc2_conformance_data): Data
  files (e.g. test pictures) used in the conformance testing process.

This software's test suite implements a formal verification processes to ensure
consistency with the VC-2 specification. This process uses code generated by
the [`vc2_pseudocode_parser`](https://github.com/bbc/vc2_pseudocode_parser)
package.
