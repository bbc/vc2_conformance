Conformance software development guide
--------------------------------------

This part of the documentation provides a guide to the VC-2 conformance
software internals. This documentation is aimed at maintainers of the VC-2
conformance software. Users of the VC-2 conformance software need not read
this, or later sections.

The maintainer's manual aims to provide a 'big picture' view of the software
architecture along with more detailed introductions to each of the main
concepts and components within. It does not, however, provide an exhaustive
reference including every minor component in the codebase -- refer to the
comments and docstrings within the code in these instances.

This introductory chapter provides instructions on setting up a suitable
installation of this software for development purposes along with an overview
of the structure of the codebase. Subsequent chapters will provide in-depth
reference documentation for each of the main parts of this software.
