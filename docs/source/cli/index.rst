    conformance of VC-2 encoders and decoders.

:ref:`vc2-bitstream-validator`
    Validates the conformance of a VC-2 bitstream and produces a reference
    decoding.

:ref:`vc2-raw-compare`
    Compares pairs of pictures.

:ref:`vc2-raw-explain`
    Produces informative explanations of the video formats written and accepted
    by the VC-2 conformance software. (See :ref:`file-format`).
